### Installing the Taqo research app and joining the study

Taqo is the application that manages the study data collection. It will notify
you to participate in surveys.

1.  To join the study, please download the latest Taqo linux package:

    [Taqo Download Release Page](https://github.com/google/taqo-paco/releases)

2.  In a terminal, run the command

    ```
    %> sudo dpkg -i taqosurvey_<version>_amd64.deb
    ```

    If the command complains about missing dependencies, run

    ```
    %> sudo apt install -f

    ```

    This will install the Taqo debian package and the required dependencies. You
    may need to adjust this command to include the directory that it was
    downloaded to.

3.  Launch the Taqo client app

    ```
    %> taqo

    ```

    The Taqo app will present a login screen.

    to Google’s auth site to do the authentication.

    window.

7.  Select the study by clicking on its title. Press the button in the lower
    right corner to enroll.

8.  You will be shown the Informed Consent and Data Handling agreement, only
    proceed if you understand and accept these terms.

9.  Then, if the experiment has a user-editable schedule for notifications, you
    will be shown the Schedule for sampling. You can modify this schedule to
    suit your hours for study participation. Click the save button in the lower
    right once you are done and use the back arrow to navigate out.

    ![alt_text](images/7-schedule.png "image_tooltip") You are now enrolled in
    the study and can close the Taqo app. It will notify you if it is time to
    participate in a survey.

10. NOTE: If you are participating in a developer logging study, please do the
    following two steps to enable the loggers. Otherwise, the study will not
    collect developer activity and may not be able to detect events that would
    trigger surveys.

11. Restart any IntelliJ-based IDEs to enable the dev logging plugin

12. Restart your terminal or source your .bashrc or .zshrc file to enable
    terminal command logging `%> source ~/.bashrc`

### Responding to a Survey Notification

If the study needs you to fill out a survey, it will pop up a desktop
notification. Click that notification to be taken to the survey. Or, you can
open Taqo and click on the Study name to fill out the survey.

Click Submit in the lower right hand corner when you are done.

### Pausing the study

To pause data collection, open Taqo and click the “⏸” icon to the right of the
study name. This will pause the survey’s data collection until you click again
to resume.

### Leaving the study

At any time, you can open the Taqo app and stop the study by clicking the ‘X’
icon to the right of the study name.

Note: If you are in a logging study, please leave the study by this method to
cleanly remove any IDE plugins and shell loggers (located in the .rc file) from
your desktop environment.

After leaving a study explicitly, or, if a study has ended, you can uninstall
Taqo.

For a full uninstall, you can run the following commands:

```
    sudo apt remove taqosurvey
    sudo apt autoremove

    rm -rf ~/.local/share/taqo
```
